# Manifest

> To be an **OPEN open source project** is to embrace the following:

> I. Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are given commit-access to the project to contribute as they see fit.

> I. The project wants to be considered more like an open wiki built on collective efforts than a walled garden guarded by its founders.
